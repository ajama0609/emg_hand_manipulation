# EMG Hand Gesture Classification

## Introduction

Surface electromyography (sEMG) is widely used for hand gesture recognition due to its non-invasive nature and rich muscle activity information. Many studies have demonstrated that machine learning models, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can achieve around **90% accuracy** on multi-class hand gesture classification tasks using sEMG data [1,2,3]. For example, Chen et al. [3] reported classification accuracies up to 98% with CNNs on a larger set of gestures, while simpler MLP architectures often achieve slightly lower but comparable results [2].

A notable and consistent challenge across the literature is the classification of the **rest state**, where muscle activation is minimal and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. This leads to frequent misclassification and lowers overall system reliability [4,5]. Lobov et al. [4] specifically identify latent factors such as low SNR and inter-subject variability as key limitations for sEMG-based interfaces.

In this study, we achieve up to **92% accuracy** using a 4-layer MLP on six hand gestures, including the rest state, which aligns well with these prior findings. Our work demonstrates that with careful preprocessing and model design, MLPs can be competitive alternatives to deeper CNNs for real-time gesture recognition applications.

# Methodology

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

EMG signals were recorded using the **MYO Thalmic bracelet**, which contains eight equally spaced sensors around the forearm, transmitting data via Bluetooth to a PC.

Preprocessing of raw EMG signals was performed using a MATLAB script. Key preprocessing steps include:

- **Filtering:** A **10th order Butterworth bandpass filter** was implemented with cutoff frequencies between **20 Hz and 450 Hz** to remove motion artifacts, baseline drift, and high-frequency noise outside the typical EMG frequency range.  
- **Segmentation:** Signals were segmented according to gesture labels with pauses between gesture executions to minimize overlap.

These preprocessing steps help enhance signal quality and improve classifier performance.

# EMG Pattern Database

The dataset consists of raw EMG data from **36 subjects** performing a series of static hand gestures. Each subject performed two series, each containing six (sometimes seven) basic gestures. Each gesture was held for 3 seconds, followed by a 3-second rest period.

### Description of raw data files

Each data file contains 10 columns:

1. **Time:** Timestamp in milliseconds  
2-9. **Channels 1-8:** EMG signals from the eight sensors of the MYO Thalmic bracelet  
10. **Class label:** Gesture identifiers  
    - 0: Unmarked data  
    - 1: Hand at rest  
    - 2: Hand clenched in a fist  
    - 3: Wrist flexion  
    - 4: Wrist extension  
    - 5: Radial deviation  
    - 6: Ulnar deviation  
    - 7: Extended palm (not performed by all subjects)

# Results

The current model achieves up to **92% accuracy** across six gesture classes:

- Resting  
- Fist clenched  
- Wrist flexion  
- Wrist extension  
- Ulnar deviation  
- Radial deviation  

The confusion matrix below highlights that most misclassifications occur in the resting state, confirming that low SNR in relaxed muscles poses a classification challenge:
